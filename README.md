## Introduction ##
### What is Gymlink ###
Gymlink is a managing software made specifically for gym owners, allowing their  
employees to efficiently manage the clients and the inventory of the gym, as well as  
the creation of routines for the clients by the trainers.
### How it started ###
The project idea came up because of the need of the users of an efficient way to  
create gym routines without the need to use paid softwares or having it written down  
on paper.
